Subject: Resignation Email

Hi Mr. Sandeep Verma,

I hope you're doing well. I’m writing to officially inform you that I am resigning from my position as Marketing Executive at TechNova Solutions, with my last working day being 30th June 2025.

This decision was not easy, but I feel it's time for me to explore new directions in my career. I’m really thankful for the support, learning, and positive work environment I experienced here. Working with you and the entire team has been a great journey.

Please let me know how I can help during the transition period. I’ll ensure a smooth handover of my responsibilities.

Thanks again for everything. Wishing you and the company continued success ahead!

Warm regards,
Rohit Sharma

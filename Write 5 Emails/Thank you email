Subject: Thank You for the Book Idea!

Hi Mr. Arjun Mehta,

Thank you so much for telling me about the book “The Midnight Library” by Matt Haig. I read it recently, and I really liked it!

It made me think in a new way, and I enjoyed the story a lot. I already shared it with a friend who also loves reading.

Thanks again for your kind suggestion!

Best regards,
Neha Kapoor

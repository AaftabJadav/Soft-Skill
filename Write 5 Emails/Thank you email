Subject: Thank You So Much for the Wonderful Book Suggestion

Hi Mr. Arjun Mehta,

I hope you are doing well. I wanted to say a big thank you for recommending the book “The Midnight Library” by Matt Haig. I finished reading it last week, and I really enjoyed every part of it.

The story was interesting and gave me a lot to think about. It made me understand how every choice we make can change our life in a different way. I never thought about life like that before. Your suggestion came at the perfect time because I was looking for something meaningful to read.

I also shared the book with one of my close friends. She started reading it and said she’s loving it too! So, your one suggestion made two people happy!

Thank you again for being so thoughtful. I really appreciate it and look forward to more of your great book ideas.

Take care and stay in touch.

Warm regards,
Neha Kapoor

Subject: Friendly Reminder About Our Meeting

Hi Mr. Karan Joshi,

I hope you’re doing well. I just wanted to send a quick and friendly reminder about our upcoming meeting scheduled for Thursday at 11:00 AM.

We planned to discuss the new project ideas and the next steps. Please let me know if the time still works for you, or if you would like to reschedule. I’m happy to adjust if needed.

Looking forward to our conversation. Let me know if you need any documents or details from my side before the meeting.

Thanks in advance!

Best regards,
Anjali Rao

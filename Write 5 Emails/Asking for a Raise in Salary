Subject: Request for Salary Raise

Hi Mr. Arvind Tiwari,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to take a moment to talk about my current salary.

I’ve really enjoyed working at SkyNet Solutions as a Graphic Designer, and I’ve given my best in every project. Over the past few months, I’ve handled extra responsibilities, met deadlines, and contributed to team success in many ways.

Based on my performance and dedication, I would like to kindly request a review of my current salary. I believe a raise would reflect the value I bring to the team and motivate me even more.

Please let me know if we can schedule a time to discuss this further.

Thank you for your time and support!

Best regards,
Aman Kapoor

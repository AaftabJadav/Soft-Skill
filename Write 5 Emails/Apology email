Subject: I’m Really Sorry for the Delay in Replying

Hi Ms. Priya Sharma,

I hope you are doing well. I’m writing this message to say sorry for not replying to your email earlier. I know you took the time to write to me, and I feel bad that I didn’t respond quickly.

I was caught up with some urgent work and personal things, and somehow I missed replying on time. It was not my intention to ignore your message. I really value our communication, and I want to be more careful in the future.

Please accept my sincere apology for the delay. I understand that time is important, and I will try my best not to let this happen again.

Thank you for your patience and understanding. I hope we can continue to stay in touch.

Warm regards,
Rohit Verma
